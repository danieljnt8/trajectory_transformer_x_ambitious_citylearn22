# Trajectory Transformer with AmbitiousEngineers Agent for CityLearn Challenge 2022

This repository combines the Trajectory Transformer with the AmbitiousEngineers agent to participate in the CityLearn Challenge 2022. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2.	Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Generation
Before training the Trajectory Transformer, you need to generate data using the AmbitiousEngineers agent.

1. Run the data generator script:
```bash
python data_generator.py
```

This script will generate the dataset required for training the Trajectory Transformer. The generated data will be saved in a directory specified in your configuration file.

## Configuration

Before training the model, ensure that the configuration file is properly set up. An example configuration is provided in configs/medium/city_learn_traj_winner.yaml. Adjust the model configuration as needed. Ensure you specify the location where the dataset generated by data_generator.py is saved.

## Training

1. Run the training script:
```bash
python train_traj.py
```

The trained model will be saved in the checkpoint/ folder.

## Evaluation

For evaluation, we provide three scripts for different zones:
eval_1.py, eval_2.py, and eval_3.py

## Folder Structure

- `configs/`: Contains configuration files for different environments.
- `checkpoint/`: Stores the trained model checkpoints.
- `data_generator.py`: Generates data using the AmbitiousEngineers agent.
- `train_traj.py`: Script for training the Trajectory Transformer.
- `eval_1.py`, `eval_2.py`, `eval_3.py`: Scripts for evaluating the model in different zones.
